# Arduino-NodeMCU_SerialCommunication
The program is used to enable serial communication between arduino and NoduMCU.
The program can exchange integers, floating points, strings, and characters
Input the values into value_1,value_3,value_3.
Upload the code code in arduino to the arduino and NoduMCU to NodeMCU.
You can also use this code to exchange data between two arduinos as well.
