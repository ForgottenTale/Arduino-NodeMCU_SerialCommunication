# Arduino-NodeMCU_SerialCommunication
This program is used to enable serial communication between arduino and NoduMCU esp8266 / arduino.

The program can exchange integers, floating points, strings, and characters

Input the values into value_1,value_3,value_3.

Convert the string value recieved by the NodeMCU to your desired datatype in the NodeMCU code.

Connect digital pins 5 and 6 of arduino to the digital pins 5 and 6 of NodeMCU repectively

Upload the code code in arduino to the arduino and NoduMCU to NodeMCU.

You can also use this code to exchange data between two arduinos as well.
