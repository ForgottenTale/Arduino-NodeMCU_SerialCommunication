# Arduino-NodeMCU_SerialCommunication
This program is used to enable serial communication between arduino and NoduMCU esp8266 / arduino.

The program can exchange integers, floating points, strings, and characters

Input the values into value_1,value_3,value_3.

Convert the string value recieved by the NodeMCU to your desired datatype in the NodeMCU code.

Upload the code code in arduino to the arduino and NoduMCU to NodeMCU.

You can also use this code to exchange data between two arduinos as well.
